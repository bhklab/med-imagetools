### Refactoring

  ([#185](https://github.com/bhklab/med-imagetools/pull/185),
  [`093eab0`](https://github.com/bhklab/med-imagetools/commit/093eab03f441049f9bec4b457e4e24185218f7d7))

## Walkthrough

This pull request introduces significant refactoring across multiple modules in the image tools
  library, focusing on DICOM reading and processing functions. The changes centralize image reading
  functionality into a new `read_image` utility function in the `utils.py` module, rename several
  method signatures to use a more generic `from_dicom` approach, and improve the handling of DICOM
  metadata across different image types like Dose, PET, and StructureSet. The modifications aim to
  standardize the DICOM reading process and enhance code modularity.

## Changes

  `read_dicom_rtstruct` with optional `roi_name_pattern` parameter<br>- Modified method calls for

## v1.12.0 (2025-01-15)

  ([#165](https://github.com/bhklab/med-imagetools/pull/165),
  [`5333a80`](https://github.com/bhklab/med-imagetools/commit/5333a80c6b2242c12d384846a3649a94a9eea60f))


## v1.11.2 (2025-01-15)

### Bug Fixes

## v1.11.1 (2025-01-11)

### Bug Fixes

- Rounding error in resample function ([#163](https://github.com/bhklab/med-imagetools/pull/163),
  [`f57a747`](https://github.com/bhklab/med-imagetools/commit/f57a7473b2dd5e14b12f4cdd833b9ecc1b60e6ad))

When output_size was not provided to `resample` function, the size was determined based on the
  spacing but was floored. This would sometimes incorrectly shrink the image size. Changed to use
  `np.round` instead.

Additionally, added the `output_size` argument to the `resample` call in the `resize` function. The
  output size is already available in the function as `new_size`, so it doesn't make sense to
  recalculate it in the `resample` function.

<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->

## Summary by CodeRabbit

- **Bug Fixes** - Improved image resampling and resizing functions with more precise rounding and
  type handling. - Enhanced parameter validation to ensure consistent integer conversion.
